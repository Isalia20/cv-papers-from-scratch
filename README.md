# Computer vision papers from scratch

Repository for implementing computer vision papers from scratch. Each model is self contained(no imports from other packages/models, only torch and base python) and are easy to read/understand. Goal of this repository is to have a quick lookup place for the most famous models/training techniques for seamless integration in your current workflow
