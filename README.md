# Computer vision papers from scratch

Repository for implementing computer vision papers from scratch. Each model is self contained(no imports from other models) and are easy to read/understand.

## Papers implemented:

- [x] [Vision transformer needs register](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16588)
- [x] [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597)

## Papers to be implemented:

- [ ] [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12872)
- [ ] [DINO: Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14294)
- [ ] [DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07193)
- [ ] [Convnext - A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03545)
- [ ] and many others
